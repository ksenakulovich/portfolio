All the documentation is written about a fictious web application that I've come up; 'MyTastes' is a web application designed to provide users with an opportunity
to share their tastes in music, literature, and movies online. There are three modules supposed to be implemented in this product: Audio, Films, and Library.
The documentation in this folder is about the 'Library' module, provides examples of the standard artifacts to be written 
for such a project and cannot be considered finalized.
You can find several mockups created by me for this module to make these documents more followable.

Here is more info about the content of this folder: 
1. There are two checklists: 'Kseniya Akulovich - Checklist for 'MyTastes'_full' and 'Kseniya Akulovich - Checklist for 'MyTastes'_only general titles'. 
The first one should be used on a project where there is no other documentation being kept, which is why it looks verbose and comprehensive. 
The second one is more concise and is a suitable option on a project with a full set of documents (TCs, well-written requirements etc.)
2. The 'Kseniya Akulovich - Test Cases for 'MyTastes' file contains examples of test cases for smoke/critical path/extended testing.
3. For bug reporting examples, please see 'Kseniya Akulovich - Bug reports for 'MyTastes' and two screenshots from JIRA (Bug_Part1 and Bug_Part2).
